This project is being undertaken as a part of the [Semester Long Project(SloP) Program](http://slop.dscdaiict.in/) by DSC, DA-IICT.

Project is Live at [Devagram](https://app-devagram.web.app/)

The project is aimed to be a Full Stack DevExchange platform which can allow members of the developer community to post news, project showcases and profiles.

It is aimed to be executed via a complete Agile Software Development Lifecycle, starting with Requirement Elicitation, High and Low level system designs, Wireframe creation,
Development using the MERN stack(MongoDB, Express, Node, React), end to end testing and deployment via CI-CD.

The aim of the project is to give contributors a comprehensive idea about the development pipeline in the industry.

There are no 'prerequisites' as such, but you're best off a fast learner, devoted to the job, and determined to see it through, in spite of bugs.

Tentative project structure :

1. Assuming a total team strength of x, x/3 students will be working on Front-End, x/3 on Back-End and x/3 on databases/devops/deployment.

2. Collaboration will be through GitHub, discussions via Slack/Gitter and team huddles over Google Meet.

3. The process will be Scrum, with daily standup calls to discuss on the progress, impediments and plans of the team.

4. Every bit of code will be unit tested before being merged into master.

5. I will provide all resources for development including access to courses on [Udacity](https://udacity.com), [Udemy](https://udemy.com/), [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com), [Educative](https://educative.io) and others.

6. The deliverable will be a Minimum Viable Product, deployed and tested on 50 users.

7. The project is aimed to appreciate the process of Software Development that happens in big tech companies, and startups alike.
